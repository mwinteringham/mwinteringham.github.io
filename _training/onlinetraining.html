            <p>As well in person training I also offer online training courses via Ministry of Testing's Dojo. Which are accessible via a Pro Dojo account. These are the current courses that I offer online:</p>

            <h2>Let's build an API checking framework</h2>
            <p>Let's build an API checking framework takes you through the steps required to build your first Java API checking / automated testing framework. Each video shows you how to setup and create increasingly more sophisticated automated checks whilst explaining design patterns and good practise in building your code base.</p>

            <h2>Building blocks of the internet</h2>
            <p>Testers who are involved in testing web based products are likely to interact with them with browsers or HTTP tools, but do you really know what technologies make up your product and how they work together? In the building blocks of the internet, you will be introduced to each web based technology in this hands on series of exercies and discussions.</p>

            <h2>Introduction To HTTP</h2>
            <p>When testing APIs, building automated API checking frameworks or building tools on the web, a deep understanding of HTTP is required. Introduction to HTTP takes you through the rules of HTTP, ideas for test design and the risks that might affect both HTTP requests and responses. By the end, you will be an HTTP pro ready for your API journey</p>
