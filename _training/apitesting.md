## Why You Should Take This Course

Web services and APIs have exploded in popularity over the past few years. More companies are adopting architectures such as:

* Software as a service
* Web service architecture
* Microservice architecture

These approaches present new opportunities and problems for teams to solve. To help them solve these challenges, teams are looking for testers who can help with:

* Testing features that lack a User interface
* Working with platforms of interconnected web services
* Building automated tests that integrate with APIs and web services
* Conduct exploratory testing against web services and APIs

‘Testing web services and APIs’ offers you the opportunity to learn about Web services / APIs and how to test them. You will be shown how to build HTTP requests to query and create data in web services. These skills will then be put to use to explore, plan and create both automated and exploratory tests. There will also be hands-on time to learn about popular API testing tools such as Postman and web proxies to help you in your testing activities.

The course itself is highly interactive. You will take part in exercises that offer a hands-on approach to learning the tools and ideas required to be successful in your testing. By the end of the course, you will have tested live APIs, searched for bugs and build automated tests to give you a real taste of Web service and API testing.

## What You Will Learn In This Course

In the morning we start by understanding and testing an individual web service. There will be many hands-on exercises with a web service filled with bugs to practise your new skills. We will focus on:

* What is a Web service?
* How to build requests to query and manipulate data from a Web service
* Test design techniques to consider when testing a Web service
* What is REST and what makes a Web service RESTful?

We will cover the basics of Postman to create requests and read responses. You'll then use Postman to search for bugs with different test design techniques. By the end of the morning, attendees will be able to:

* Describe what a web service and an API is
* Explain the fundamentals of web service architectures
* Construct HTTP requests to query and manipulate data
* Choose different test design techniques when testing web services and APIs
* Deconstruct HTTP response to discover information and bugs

In the afternoon we build upon your new knowledge of how test web services and APIs. We will focus on a SaaS product and look at how we can learn about it and plan our testing. We will focus on:

* How to explore many web services in a product
* How to build a model of your web services
* Planning your testing based on your application model
* How to automate your tests using Postman

We will cover new tools such as web proxies, developer tools and log monitoring. These tools will help support your future testing activities. By the end of the afternoon, attendees will be able to:

* Choose different tools to help learn more about products that use web services and APIs
* Organise the information you learn into a model of the product to help plan your testing
* Plan different types of testing activities you would want to carry out using your model
* Construct different types of automated tests for your web services and APIs

## What You Will Need To Bring

Please bring a laptop, OS X, Linux or Windows that you can install software on and connect to easily wifi with.

## Is This Course For You?

__I have no coding or technical skills, should I come?__

Yes, you should. The course is designed for beginners and experienced attendees alike. We will be using a tool called Postman, which is a great tool for beginners. It has a clean and simple user interface that hides the complexity. It’s automated testing features are very easy to use and even offers reusable code snippets. So no prior coding knowledge is needed.

__I have some experience working with web services and APIs already. Is the course to basic for me?__

Whilst the course goes back to the start of working with web services and APIs, it can be useful to go back to basics. We will be going over each aspect of HTTP in fine detail and exploring test design ideas for each part. You may find new tricks and tips that you before didn’t know, and improve your current understanding.
