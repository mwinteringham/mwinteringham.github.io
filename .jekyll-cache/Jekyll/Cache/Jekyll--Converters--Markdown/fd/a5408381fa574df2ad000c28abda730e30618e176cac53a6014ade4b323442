Iâ€™ve done this by building a model of BDD and explored both the collaborative and Outside in development sections.  If youâ€™ve not already read them <a href="http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/category/bdd/">I would recommend you do to give some context</a> to my conclusion on is BDD testing?</p>
