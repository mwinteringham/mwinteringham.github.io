I"ú<p>Iâ€™m proud to announce a new project that Iâ€™ve just released, a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wiremock-extension/ikiaofdpbmofgmlhajfnhdjelkleljbl">chrome extension for Wiremock</a>.  The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wiremock-extension/ikiaofdpbmofgmlhajfnhdjelkleljbl"> Wiremock chrome extension </a> provides users with a simple GUI that allows you to create, view, edit and delete stubs that are stored within Wiremock.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve not come across <a href="http://wiremock.org/">Wiremock</a> before, itâ€™s a great tool and Iâ€™m a huge fan it!  It offers all sorts of cool features, like how you can use Wiremock to create a programmable mock server to receive HTTP requests and respond back with programmed responses.  I found it to be a great tool in an exploratory testing context and when testing one application I spent a lot of time priming Wiremock to test how it handled different responses, which required a lot of back and forth between the browser and Wiremock.  So over the past 8 months I have been working on this extension to allow Testers and Developers to quickly program Wiremock and see the results without leaving the browser.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wiremock-extension/ikiaofdpbmofgmlhajfnhdjelkleljbl">download the extension from here</a> but if you want to know more, check out some of the features in more detailâ€¦</p>
