I"@<p>I’m pretty busy at the moment preparing for awesome workshops for <a href="https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/castx17/">CASTx with Abby Bangser</a> and TestBash Brighton with <a href="dojo.ministryoftesting.com/events/testbash-brighton-2017">Software testing clinic</a>.  So sadly it means another short post for now, but it’s still one I think that’s very exciting.  I want to share with you all a repository I’ve created that contains templates of framework written in different languages for you to use to create an API test framework.</p>
