I" <h3 id="why-bdd">Why BDD?</h3>
<p>Teams with poor communication and collaboration techniques are more likely to produce features that don’t match the business vision or that contain bugs. One of the most common causes of bugs and delays in projects is a lack of shared understanding of the software user requirements between product owners, developer and testers - <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~slauesen/Papers/PrevDefectsProceedings.pdf" target="_blank" alt="Statistics for team rework">accounting for 54% of defects in delivered software</a>.</p>

<p>Applying BDD techniques ensures that requirements are understood by all members of the agile team – from day one and as the project evolves.</p>

<h3 id="at-a-glance">At a glance</h3>
<p>This course focuses on the application of BDD techniques in agile software development projects, to help teams build software products that perform as they’re meant to.</p>

<p>Through a series of practical exercises, discussions and workshops, this course helps participants to translate business requirements into user stories that can be understood by everyone involved in the project. The course is delivered over 2 days, at your premises, for up to 20 people.</p>

<h3 id="course-outcome">Course outcome</h3>
<p>By the end of the course attendees will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe and apply the principles of BDD, including collaboration to achieve shared understanding of software requirements</li>
  <li>Understand why requirements get interpreted differently, the cognitive biases behind it and how to use techniques to identify hidden users or actors within requirements</li>
  <li>Work with Gherkin syntax to formulate examples that succinctly describe requirements and their behaviours, and convert them into automated acceptance tests using Cucumber-JVM</li>
  <li>Understand BDD involvement throughout the software development lifecycle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="benefits-of-attending">Benefits of attending</h3>
<p>The course offers specific benefits to different roles that, when combined, can make a team more effective in delivering a quality product:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product owners</strong> will understand why requirements need examples and how to write them in the Given When Then format</li>
  <li><strong>Developers</strong> will be able to asks questions that discover examples and clarify requirements before development starts. They will also be able to use Cucumber-JVM to turn the examples into automated acceptance tests</li>
  <li><strong>Testers</strong> will learn how to use collaboration as a means to test ideas early, prevent defects and to identify risks for future testing activities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-syllabus">Course syllabus</h3>
<p>Topics to be covered during the 2-day course will incorporate a range of activities based around understanding, application and analysis.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Clarifying requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Formulate examples that succinctly describe requirements and their behaviors</li>
  <li>Use example mapping to help discover requirements from acceptance criteria</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="day-2">Day 2</h4>
<p>This session is more technical with a focus on Cucumber-JVM, and is suitable for developers and testers.</p>

<p>Attendees should have basic knowledge of writing Java code to be able to understand the code examples and participate in the practical activities, although no previous knowledge of any existing testing framework or library is required.</p>
