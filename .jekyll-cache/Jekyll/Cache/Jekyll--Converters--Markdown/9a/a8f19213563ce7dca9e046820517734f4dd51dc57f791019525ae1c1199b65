I"û<p>Since being introduced to <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> a few years back itâ€™s become one of the main tools I use in my day to day testing and itâ€™s a cracking piece of kit for testing with a lot of great features to boot. For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> itâ€™s an app for Chrome that allows you to create HTTP requests for Web and API testing as well as save requests into collections for future use.</p>
