I"¦<p>For a while now Iâ€™ve wanted to do a series of posts on howÂ to build an automated API / web service / integration testingÂ framework and especially how to build one in a robust way. Â There is a lot to go over soÂ I plan to break this series up into three posts to focus on specific areas of the framework and in this one weâ€™ll focus on getting theÂ framework up and running with a handful of automated checks.</p>
