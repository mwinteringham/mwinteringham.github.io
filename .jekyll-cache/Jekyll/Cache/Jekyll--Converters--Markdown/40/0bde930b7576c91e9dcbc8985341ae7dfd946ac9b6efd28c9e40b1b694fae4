I"h<p>In the <a href="http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/category/bdd/">previous posts</a> I’ve introduced a model to help me understand BDD, shown below. I’ve also discussed the <a href="http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/bdd-testing-part-2/">collaboration side of the model</a> and the Testers role with it.  All with the intent to ask, is BDD Testing?</p>
