I"Û<p>Itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve done an unexpected automation themed post due to my work on my API Testing tutorial at CASTx2017. So I thought given I recently created the <a href="http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/wiremock-chrome-extension/">Wiremock Chrome Extension</a>, why not demonstrate how easy it is to create your own Chrome extension.  So for this post, I want to share my experience of how you can quickly create an automated form filler in the form of a chrome extension that can fill in test data for you.  This is based upon a new project I started recently and how one of the first things I looked to automate was quickly populating a large form that I regularly testing in an exploratory testing context.</p>
