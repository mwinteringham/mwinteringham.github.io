I"+<p>Postman cheat sheet is something I have wanted to put together for a while as a response to helping attendees of my <a href="http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/testing-web-services-training/">Testing API and Web services training</a>. The cheat contains a high-level collection of the features available in Postman to help you to automate APIs and Web services. Unless stated otherwise the methods below are used in the <strong>Tests tab</strong> and some can be found on the right-hand section of the Tests tab labelled <strong>snippets</strong>.</p>
