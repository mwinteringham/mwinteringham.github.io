I"ä	<p>My last few blogs have been fairly full on, so this post I wanted to give a quick demonstration on copying HTTP requests from Developer tools to Postman.  Before I begin itâ€™s worth mentioning that this works for both Developer Tools and Firebug.</p>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>Iâ€™m a big fan of using proxies and Iâ€™ve even posted about <a href="http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/category/proxies/">getting them setup</a> a few times, but they can sometimes be an interference when testing.  So naturally there are times I donâ€™t use them when carrying out certain testing, but then this happens:</p>

<p>I will be in the middle of testing an application when an error occurs on the page.  Iâ€™ll go to my developer tools and check the Network tab to see a request has been returned a 500 or 400 status code error.  The issue I might have is that I want to explore the request further, or save it for later to add to a bug.  Whilst itâ€™s not impossible to do some of these tasks in Developer tools, it can be a bit of a pain and I certainly canâ€™t save the request for the future.  However, I can with Postman so letâ€™s look at how we can do thatâ€¦</p>

<h4>Copying HTTP requests from Developer tools to Postman</h4>

<h5>1. With the network tab open, right click on the request and select â€˜copy as Curlâ€™</h5>

<h5>2. Next open up Postman and click on Import</h5>

<h5>3. Select past raw text and copy in the Curl request</h5>

<h5>4. Click import and your request will be imported to use and save in collections</h5>
