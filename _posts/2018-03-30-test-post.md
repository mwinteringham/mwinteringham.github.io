I'm proud to announce a new project that I've just released, a [chrome extension for Wiremock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wiremock-extension/ikiaofdpbmofgmlhajfnhdjelkleljbl).  The [ Wiremock chrome extension ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wiremock-extension/ikiaofdpbmofgmlhajfnhdjelkleljbl) provides users with a simple GUI that allows you to create, view, edit and delete stubs that are stored within Wiremock.

If you've not come across [Wiremock](http://wiremock.org/) before, it's a great tool and I'm a huge fan it!  It offers all sorts of cool features, like how you can use Wiremock to create a programmable mock server to receive HTTP requests and respond back with programmed responses.  I found it to be a great tool in an exploratory testing context and when testing one application I spent a lot of time priming Wiremock to test how it handled different responses, which required a lot of back and forth between the browser and Wiremock.  So over the past 8 months I have been working on this extension to allow Testers and Developers to quickly program Wiremock and see the results without leaving the browser.

You can [download the extension from here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wiremock-extension/ikiaofdpbmofgmlhajfnhdjelkleljbl) but if you want to know more, check out some of the features in more detail...
