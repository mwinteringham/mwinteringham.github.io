Over the summer I gave a new talk called 'Say TaTTa to your TuTTu' at [Liverpool tester gathering](https://www.meetup.com/Liverpool-Tester-Gathering/) which expands upon my previous blog post [Anti-pattern: Cross browser checking](http://www.mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/cross-browser-checking-anti-pattern/)

The talk was recorded and you can view it below, and sorry about the weird cable in the middle of the video!

Once again a big thank you [Liverpool tester gathering](https://www.meetup.com/Liverpool-Tester-Gathering/) for putting me on and if you live in the North West area I encourage you to head to their next session as they have some great speakers and regular attendees.  Also if you're interested in learning more about targeted automation testing, check out my upcoming courses with the [Masters of the Ministry](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/training-events/).
