<h3>You get an API testing demo, you get an API testing demo, everybody gets an API testing demo!</h3>

For those who've attended my API training course, they get the opportunity to test their newly discovered skills against a purpose built Web API called [restful-booker](github.com/mwinteringham/restful-booker). It comes jam packed with features and bugs to find and it has always been [available via open source here](github.com/mwinteringham/restful-booker). However, not everyone has a technical background or wants to mess around installing Node and setting up databases. That's why after a chat about all things API testing with [Evil Tester](http://eviltester.com/), I updated [restful-booker](github.com/mwinteringham/restful-booker) and have released it on [Heroku](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) as an API testing demo for everyone to use at any time. How great is that!

<h3>Sounds awesome, let me at it!</h3>

You can find the deployed API at [https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) and it's available for you to practise your API testing skills, try out tools such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or run your brand new API checking framework against. So go check out the documentation at [https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) and have a play :)

Finally, if you find any issues that cause the server to die or have any suggestions to improve the API then please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/2bittester) or [fork the code and open a pull request](github.com/mwinteringham/restful-booker).
